<h3> General </h3>
<p class = 'small'>
	At Harvard, I'm concentrating in Statistics with a minor in CS - a nice way to sum up my academic endeavors is that I study applied math from a theoretical perspective. I will (hopefully!) graduate in May 2021. </p>

<p class = 'small'>
	In high school, I was a competitive debater, and I continue to compete internationally for the Harvard debate team. I'm also a classical pianist and flutist (there are an embarassing number of videos of my performances on youtube). My other interests include public policy, economics, and fantasy/science fiction.

<h3> Family & Friends </h3>
<p class = 'small'>
I have two siblings and they are both cooler than me. 

My twin sister Emily is a 
<a href = 'https://emilyspector.bandcamp.com/'>rock star</a>
 who attends Harvard as well as the Berklee College of Music. 

 My brother Ben is a <a href = 'https://github.com/Sydriax'>total nerd</a> at MIT who wrote the first iteration of the <a href = 'https://halite.io/'>Halite Programming Challenge</a> when he was 15. 

 Here's a picture of us in Yosemite from August 2017:

	We also play together in an award-winning <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWEVOJ4i2A'>piano trio</a>.

<p class = 'small'> My long-time girlfriend 
	<a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/mollygrazioso/'>Molly Grazioso</a>
	is an advocate for sexual education and reproductive health. Check out her (really awesome) website at <a href = 'https://www.realsextalk.org/'> https://www.realsextalk.org/ </a>. I've included a pretty cute (in my opinion) picture of us below.
