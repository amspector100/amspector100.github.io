<h3> General </h3>
<p class = 'small'>
  I just graduated from Harvard ('21), where I received a B.A. in statistics and mathematics. I study methods in high-dimensional inference with Professor <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/> Lucas Janson</a>. In fall 2021, I will start a PhD in statistics at Stanford.

  Outside of research, I'm a classical pianist and flutist (there are an embarassing number of videos of my performances on youtube). In college, I also competed internationally for Harvard's debate team, and I try to remain (somewhat) active in that community. My other interests include public policy, economics, and fantasy/science fiction books.

<h3> Family & Friends </h3>
<p class = 'small'>
I have two siblings, and they are both cooler than me. 

My twin sister Emily is a 
<a href = 'https://emilyspector.bandcamp.com/'>rock star</a>
 who attends Harvard as well as the Berklee College of Music. 

 My brother Ben is a <a href = 'https://github.com/Sydriax'>total nerd</a> at MIT who wrote the first iteration of the <a href = 'https://halite.io/'>Halite Programming Challenge</a> when he was 15. 

 Here's a picture of us in Yosemite from August 2017:

	We also play together in an award-winning <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWEVOJ4i2A'>piano trio</a>.
