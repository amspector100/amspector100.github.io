<h3> Academics </h3>

I am a first year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I study problems in high-dimensional statistics. I am broadly interested in developing modern methods to prevent false positives in scientific analyses. I am supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.


<p>
Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by Professor <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/> Lucas Janson</a>.

<h3> Other activities </h3>

<p>
Outside of research, I'm a classical pianist and flutist. In college, I also competed internationally for Harvard's debate team, and I remain active in that community. My other interests include public policy, economics, and fantasy/science fiction books.
