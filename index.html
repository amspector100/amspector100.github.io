<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a second year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I study problems in high-dimensional statistics. I am broadly interested in developing modern methods to improve robustness of machine learning algorithms and prevent false positives in scientific analyses. I am supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Please see <a href=/assets/docs/cv.pdf>here</a> for my CV.

Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by Professor <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/> Lucas Janson</a>.

<h2> News </h2>

<ul>
	<li>Will Fithian and I have a new paper on asymptotically optimal knockoff feature statistics---read the draft <a href=/assets/docs/mlrknock.pdf>here</a>!
	<li>Check out our <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17208'>new paper on BLiP</a>, which is a method for jointly detecting and localizing signals in applications ranging from genetic fine-mapping to astronomical point source detection. </li>
