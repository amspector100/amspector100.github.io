<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a third year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I am advised by <a href=https://candes.su.domains/>Emmanuel Cand√®s</a>. I study problems in high-dimensional statistics, and I focus on developing methods that provide classical statistical guarantees to modern machine learning algorithms. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Please see <a href=/assets/docs/cv.pdf>here</a> for my CV.

<br>

Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/>Lucas Janson</a>.

Previously, I did debate at Harvard. I now coach the <a href='https://debate.stanford.edu/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-1'> Stanford Debate Society.</a>
