<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a fourth year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I am advised by <a href=https://candes.su.domains/>Emmanuel Cand√®s</a>. I study problems in high-dimensional statistics, and I focus on developing methods that provide classical statistical guarantees to modern machine learning algorithms. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Citadel GQS PhD Fellowship. Please see <a href=/assets/docs/cv.pdf>here</a> for my CV.

<br>
My work is motivated by applications across many disciplines, including genetic studies, exploratory analysis of clinical trial data, economic and financial applications, and more. To this end, I am lucky to collaborate with industrial researchers, including at Novartis AG (where I am an external consultant) and BlackRock.

Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/>Lucas Janson</a>.

Previously, I did debate at Harvard. I now coach the <a href='https://debate.stanford.edu/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-1'> Stanford Debate Society.</a>
