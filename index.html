<h2> About </h2> 

<p class = 'small'>
I am a statistics PhD at Stanford, advised by <a href=https://candes.su.domains/>Emmanuel Cand√®s</a>. I build ways to deploy ML in settings where mistakes are costly (e.g. healthcare, financial risk modeling). 
My work is supported by the NSF and Citadel GQS.

<!-- Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/>Lucas Janson</a>.
