<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a fourth year PhD student in statistics at Stanford, advised by <a href=https://candes.su.domains/>Emmanuel Cand√®s</a>. I build ways to deploy AI in settings where mistakes are costly (e.g. healthcare, financial risk modelling). 
My work is supported by the NSF GRFP and the Citadel GQS PhD Fellowship. Please see also <a href=/assets/docs/cv.pdf>my CV.</a>


<br>
<br>

Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/>Lucas Janson</a>.

<br>
<br>

My research is motivated by real-world problems, and I collaborate frequently with industrial researchers, including at Novartis AG (where I am an external consultant) and BlackRock. 
I also recently spent some time working on the ML team at <a href=https://team.mercor.com/>Mercor</a>.

Previously, I did debate at Harvard. I now coach the <a href='https://debate.stanford.edu/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-stanford-debate-society/about-1'> Stanford Debate Society.</a>
