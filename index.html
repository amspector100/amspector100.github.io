<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

<h2> TL;DR </h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li> I just graduated from Harvard ('21), where I received a B.A. in statistics and math. I study methods in high-dimensional inference with Professor <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/> Lucas Janson</a>. </li>
	<li> I also compete (internationally) for Harvard's debate team. I occasionally get the chance to participate in cool public debates, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzJuHEsTJbM> like this one</a>. </li> 
	<li> 	I harbor vague ambitions to write short articles about the math behind "data science" and "machine learning," which I will occasionally post on this website.  
	</li>
	<li> In fall 2021, I will start a PhD in statistics at Stanford. </li>
</ul>
