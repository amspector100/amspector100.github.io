<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

I am a first year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I study problems in high-dimensional statistics. I am broadly interested in developing modern methods to improve robustness of machine learning algorithms and prevent false positives in scientific analyses. I am supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. in statistics and math from Harvard ('21), where I was lucky to be advised by Professor <a href=http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/> Lucas Janson</a>.
