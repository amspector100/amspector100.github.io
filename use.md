# Use

This file reminds me how to update the website, because a lot of the time I forget!

## Local jekyll

1. Setup: see https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
2. Call 'bundle exec jekyll serve' (might have to call bundle install)
3. You should be able to see the preview at http://localhost:{some_number}

If you get errors, might be worth referencing the issue here: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2136
and then looking at the gemfile/config.yml here:
